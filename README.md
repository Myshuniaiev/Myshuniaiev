# Oleksii Myshuniaiev

Hi there! My name is Oleksii Myshuniaiev, and I am a software developer with 2+ years of experience in the industry. I am currently working at Arctiq and ClearCloud corporations, where I have honed my skills in Javascript, Python, React, Redux, REST API, Apollo, Django REST Framework, GraphQL, NextJS, and more. 

## Professional Experience

My latest project involved developing a SAS application where I worked with a team of developers. We used an agile system to manage the project and worked together to develop a robust and scalable solution. My experience with UI/UX design was particularly helpful in this project, as it allowed me to contribute to creating an intuitive and user-friendly experience for our customers.
